# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Project Background

The client asked for an analysis of Amazon reviews written by members from the paid Amazon Vine Program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. The client pays a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members. The Amazon Vine members are required to publish a review.

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Amazon Vine members.

- There were 1,266 Vine reviews also known as paid reviews and 62,028 non-Vine reviews also known as unpaid reviews. 

- There were 432 Vine reviews with 5 stars and 29,982 non-Vine reviews with 5 stars.

## Summary

The analysis shows that there is no positive bias for reviews of the Vine program with less than 50% of the Vine reviews being 5 star reviews. Also, more than half of the reviews had less than 4 stars. The non-Vine 5 star reviews were closer to 50% showing there is not a positive bias. An additional analysis to support that there is no bias  is to compare the number and percentages of the reviews with 1 star.  Image Two shows that there is no negative bias as well. Therefore, there is no bias for all reviews.
